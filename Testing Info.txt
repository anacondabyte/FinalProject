The various errors I faced while working on this program wher mostly easy-to-fix syntax errors (I was somewhat lucky there)

However some errors included accessors and mutators of working incorrectly and having to be adjusted
One solution was that I made some classes no-longer needed, and those were originally a player, battler and monster class.
Without those three, the system ran with little errors.

Another issue was the inabililty to copy one of the classes in a list. My solution was to use accessors and mutators to work around
the issue.

The first issue took a while to fix, but other than that, the program runs beautifly.

 One last issue caused the delete functions in the modifications menu to convert ints to floats. Easily and quickly rectified by swapping float fucntions for int functions
